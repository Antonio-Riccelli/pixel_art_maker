## Description

Created using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

This was my first experiment in understanding how to modify the DOM using JS.

User can manually input grid height and width via a form, whose input is then "grabbed" by a JS function to create an HTML table via two nested for loops (height/column, width/row).

User chooses a color from the color picker, which can then be used to "click" the cell and give it the corresponding background color.
